This project provides analytical feedback for ESL (English as a Second Language) learners. The goal is to evaluate and provide actionable feedback to help writers and speakers cultivate their own style. The program helps users understand their emotional tone and communication style by analyzing texts through large language models (LLMs) and sentiment classification. The sentiment analysis categorizes texts into positive, negative, neutral, informal, and formal classes, offering learners insights into their emotional tone and writing style. The feedback will include ESL-specific challenges such as common hypercorrection mistakes, tone adjustments, and cultural considerations. # ESL-Sentiment-Analysis-and-Modification
Within each specific class, the sentiment categories will the system detect: confidence, hesitation, frustration, enthusiasm. The program will provide insight on cultural considerations such as usage of puns, collocations, phrases, cultural references and the like.
