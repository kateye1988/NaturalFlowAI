This project provides analytical feedback for ESL (English as a Second Language) learners. The goal is to evaluate and provide actionable feedback to help writers and speakers cultivate their own style. The program helps users understand their emotional tone and communication style by analyzing texts through large language models (LLMs) and sentiment classification. The sentiment analysis categorizes texts into positive, negative, neutral, informal, and formal classes, offering learners insights into their emotional tone and writing style. The feedback will include ESL-specific challenges such as common hypercorrection mistakes, tone adjustments, and cultural considerations. # ESL-Sentiment-Analysis-and-Modification
Within each specific class, the sentiment categories will the system detect: confidence, hesitation, frustration, enthusiasm. The program will provide insight on cultural considerations such as usage of puns, collocations, phrases, cultural references and the like.
Some Data sets that I will use: 
COCA - English Corpora - Contains native English langauge from various media platforms, including dated magazines and newspapers.  
TOEFL11 Corpus – Contains non-native English essays.
ICLE (International Corpus of Learner English)
ICNALE (International Corpus Network of Asian Learners of English) – Learner essays with proficiency levels.
Lang-8 Learner Corpus – Includes corrected texts from language learners


Why?
1. Emotional Influence on L2 Speaking
Anxiety & Hesitation: Many L2 speakers experience speech anxiety, leading to pauses, filler words, or avoidance of complex sentence structures.
Confidence & Fluency: As proficiency grows, speakers use smoother intonation, varied sentence structures, and more expressive language.
Frustration & Errors: Negative emotions (like frustration) can result in more self-corrections, broken syntax, or avoidance strategies.
2. Sentiment Analysis for L2 Speakers
Sentiment analysis can help detect and understand emotions in spoken L2 communication, leading to valuable applications such as:

Analyzing Speech Patterns: Identifying positive, neutral, or negative sentiments based on tone, fluency, and word choice.
Detecting Anxiety or Confidence Levels: Tracking pitch variations, pauses, and sentence complexity to assess emotional states.
Providing Feedback on Emotional Tone: Sentiment-aware AI  help learners adjust their speech by recognizing when they sound hesitant, assertive, or enthusiastic.
