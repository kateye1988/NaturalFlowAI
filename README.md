This project provides analytical feedback for ESL (English as a Second Language) learners. The goal is to evaluate and provide actionable feedback to help writers and speakers cultivate their own style. The program helps users understand their emotional tone and communication style by analyzing texts through large language models (LLMs) and sentiment classification. The sentiment analysis categorizes texts into positive, negative, neutral, informal, and formal classes, offering learners insights into their emotional tone and writing style.# ESL-Sentiment-Analysis-and-Modification
